      <h1>House chores</h1>
      <p>
        One may ask “House chores, are you serious?” Yes, that's right! I love
        taking care of my home, including cleaning it. I don't consider myself a
        proper house wife, as this expression seems old fashioned to me and
        often with a negative meaning. However, I admit that I find it really
        pleasing to take care of my surrounding.

        My favourite house chores include daily tiding and organising stuff,
        decorating the inside, preparing everything for guests arrival and
        gardening (especially removing weeds). I don't consider myself a great
        cook, but I love baking in my free time, and (of course) enjoy eating
        after.
