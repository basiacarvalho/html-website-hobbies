      <h1>Sport</h1>
      <p>
        Sport gives me energy and takes care of my body, so I can eat as much as
        I want without guilt, so how can I not like it! Sitting pointlessly is
        not for me. It doesn't matter weather I swim in the swimming pool, a
        lake or an ocean, weather I walk on the pavement, run in the forest or
        hike in the mountains, as long as, I can feel that my body moves.

        I used to run, play volleyball, ride a bike, go for step and basic dance
        classes. Right now, I train routinely at the gym, walk with my dogs a
        few times a day, go swimming and hike during my holiday. I'm not sure
        what is ahead of me, but I know one thing - I will always keep moving!
