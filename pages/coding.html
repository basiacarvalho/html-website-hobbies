      <h1>Coding</h1>
      <p>
        When it comes to coding, first, it was an idea for a new career path
        with great opportunities, a way to challenge myself and work on my self
        esteem (that can play on me tricks from time to time). But after my IT
        journey began, it surrounded me and my daily routine.

        Coding often tries out all my limits. It involves countless hours of
        figuring out some aspects or problems that, at the beginning, seem
        impossible to solve. However, at the same time, it gives a great
        satisfaction. When I solve a problem or learn new skill, the feeling of
        joy appears. I sit to code for a few hours and find myself there for
        most of the day. It's a sign that coding is not only my goal for a next
        profession, but also my new hobby.
