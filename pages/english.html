      <h1>English</h1>
      <p>
        With English is like never ending story for me! Since my childhood, I
        attended additional lessons, travelled to England just after high school
        for almost a year (as an au pair), completed my Bachelor's and Master's
        degrees in that field, and I was an English teacher for more than 14
        years. I hope that, in my next job, English will also play a crucial
        role.

        This language is my passion not only in a professional way but also
        privately. I love surrounding myself with it, so I often watch films on
        Netflix or in the cinema in English or at least with subtitles. I love
        reading books in English or various content on the internet. I use every
        opportunity to communicate in English, and every time it feels great!
